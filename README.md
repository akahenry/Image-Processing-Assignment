# Image Processing First Assignment
This is the first project of Fundamentals of Image Processing (UFRGS).  
I've used SFML (www.sfml-dev.org) to load, draw and save images. Also, TGUI (tgui.eu) was used to create an interface.


## Installing
It only works in Windows.
1. Download this project.
2. Unzip it.
3. Download SFML and TGUI and put these folders in the same directory of source code.
4. Put the dll's in executable's directory.
    * openal32.dll
    * sfml-graphics-d-2.dll
    * sfml-system-d-2.dll
    * sfml-window-d-2.dll
    * tgui-d.dll
  
## Running
You must drag only one image to `T1.exe` or, in command line, run
`T1.exe <image>`

This program saves as `output.jpg`. If there is any file with this name, the application will overwrite it.
